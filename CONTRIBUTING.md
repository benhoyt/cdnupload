## Issues

When opening an issue, please:

* Include full error messages or tracebacks
* Specify the cdnupload version, Python version, and operating system type and version
* Ideally include steps or a test case that reproduces the issue


## Code

Feel free to submit a pull request, but it's usually best to open an issue first, so we can discuss the changes before putting a lot of time into the fix or feature.


## Legal

By submitting a pull request, you disavow any rights or claims to any changes submitted to the cdnupload project, and assign the copyright of those changes to me (Ben Hoyt).

If you can't or don't want to reassign those rights (for example, your employment contract doesn't allow it), you should not submit a pull request. Instead, open an issue and I or someone else can do the work.

This is a legal way of saying "If you submit a pull request to us, that code becomes ours". Generally that's what open source contributors intend anyway! This enables us to continue to offer cdnupload under multiple licenses (free for open source, commercial licenses for businesses).
