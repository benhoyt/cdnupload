cdnupload works fine right now (I used it on a couple of my sites).
But here are some things I'd like to add eventually.


* tests: more unicode filename tests: src, dest, s3?
* tests: real S3 tests against a test bucket
* tests: main() tests

* remove include/exclude dirs in walk_files() more efficiently if they match?

* should we ignore permissions errors on files if --ignore-walk-errors is specified?

* support for parallel s3 uploads (multiprocessing.dummy thread pool?)
    START:
    if num_threads > 1:
        thread_pool = multiprocessing.dummy.Pool(num_threads)

    UPLOAD:
    if num_threads > 1:
        thread_pool.apply_async(destination.upload, (key, source, rel_path))
    else:
        destination.upload(key, source, rel_path)

    END:
    if num_threads > 1:
        logger.info('waiting for parallel uploads to finish')
        thread_pool.join() # or whatever
